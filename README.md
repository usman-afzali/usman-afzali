# Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a postdoctoral research fellow and PI at University of Canterbury in New Zealand, conducting research in human flourishing and religion. During my PhD, I was trained in experimental psychology and neuroscience. 

Since the end of 2022, I have been using `Git` and `GitHub` with `RStudio` with `Quarto` to learn, produce, and share code. Occasionally, I use `Matlab` too.

Psychology fascinates me a great deal and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science, focusing on pre-registration and open science. My immediate goal is to become a permanent (tenure-track) lecturer in psychology.

I am experienced in teach statistics and research methods.
