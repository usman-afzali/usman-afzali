# Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a postdoctoral research fellow and PI of the [`Muslim Diversity Study`](https://usman-afzali.github.io/muslim-diversity/), based at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.

Since the end of 2022, I have been using `GitHub` with `RStudio` and `Quarto` to learn, produce, and share code. Occasionally, I use `Matlab` and `Python` too.

I am experienced in teaching statistics, research methods, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience; and my immediate goal is to become a permanent (tenure-track) `lecturer in psychology`. Psychology and science fascinate me a great deal and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science and contribute to open science.

## Fields of Research

- Human Flourishing
- Contemplative Neuroscience
