I serve as a lecturer in the [Religion Programme](https://www.otago.ac.nz/religion) at the [University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz), where I teach courses in [Science of Religion](https://www.otago.ac.nz/subjects/srel).

My research explores how religious beliefs and practices shape human cognition, behaviour, and social dynamics. I employ a mix of quantitative, qualitative, experimental (behavioural and neuroscientific), and survey methods.

As the Principal Investigator of the [Muslim Diversity Study](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools/psyc-speech-hear/research/muslim-diversity/), I lead research on the influence of religion on social attitudes, values, flourishing, and wellbeing within Muslim communities in New Zealand. Additionally, I compare these factors across religious and non-religious groups to explore broader patterns in belief and behaviour. My work in this area includes a collaborative role in the [New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study](https://osf.io/75snb/), a 20-year longitudinal quantitative panel study of adult New Zealanders.

I hold a PhD in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, with my doctoral research focusing on memory suppression and utilising brainwave (EEG/ERP) data to investigate the possession of concealed criminal knowledge. My broader research interests include contemplative neuroscience, examining the neural correlates of rituals, meditation, and other contemplative practices.

I am passionate about advancing open science, addressing questionable research practices, and promoting ethical publishing standards in science. To this end, I actively use and advocate for open science tools like `GitHub` and `OSF`. I code primarily in `R` using `Positron` and `Quarto`, with further experience in `Matlab` and `Python`. Additionally, I am eager to explore the applications of generative `AI`, such as `ChatGPT` and `Copilot`, in academic research and teaching.
