# Welcome to my GitHub page

I completed my PhD in psychology in 2022 - training in experimental psychology and neuroscience. Since the end of 2022, I started using Git and GitHub to learn, produce, and share code. I mainly use `RStudio` with `Quarto`, occasionally, I also use `Python` and `Matlab` too.
Psychology fascinates me and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science, focusing on pre-registration and open science.

I currently teach two courses: a postgraduate course in neuroscience: [Computational Contemplative-Neuroscience](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=PSYC480&occurrence=23S1(C)&year=2023) and stats/methods: [Intermediate Research Methods and Statistics](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=PSYC344&occurrence=22S2(C)&year=2022) at [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz). 

I use GitHub to share code for the above courses and also for my research projects and creative work.
