# Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am the lead researcher (principal investigator) of the [Muslim Diversity Study](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools/psyc-speech-hear/research/muslim-diversity/), currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow and lecturer in the School of Psychology, Speech and Hearing at the University of Canterbury (Christchurch, New Zealand).

In the multi-city longitudinal Muslim Diversity Study, my team and I concentrate on investigating the effects of religion on social attitudes, values, resilience, flourishing, meaning-making, overall well-being, and experiences of Muslims in New Zealand. In this capacity, I lead a team of `28 research assistants` and numerous collaborators, fostering a collaborative and enriching research environment.

During PhD, I  received training in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, with a primary emphasis on memory suppression and utilising brainwave (EEG/ERP) data to examine possession of criminal knowledge. Additionally, my research encompasses contemplative neuroscience, where I aim to explore neural correlates of contemplative practices.

I use experimental (behavioural as well as neuroscientific) and observational research methods.

Since the end of 2022, I have been using `GitHub` with `RStudio` and `Quarto` to learn, produce, and share code. Occasionally, I use `Matlab` and `Python` too.

## Fields of Research

## Research Supervision

Since 2021, I have developed a track record of effective leading and supervising research at different levels (PhD, Masters, and Honours).

## Teaching

My experience encompasses teaching statistics, research methods, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience, consistently earning positive feedback each year. I take pride in my ability to embrace constructive criticism and continuously enhance my teaching approach. Currently, I teach the following courses:

1. Postgraduate [Computational Contemplative-Neuroscience](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=PSYC480&occurrence=23S1(C)&year=2023) (2023-Present)

2. Undergraduate [Intermediate Research Methods and Statistics](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=PSYC344&occurrence=23S2(C)&year=2023) (2022-2024)

## Career Goals

My immediate goal is to become a permanent (tenure-track) `lecturer in psychology`. Psychology and science fascinate me a great deal and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science and contribute to open science.
