# Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am the principal investigator of the [Muslim Diversity Study](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools/psyc-speech-hear/research/muslim-diversity/), currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow and lecturer in the School of Psychology, Speech and Hearing at the University of Canterbury (Christchurch, New Zealand).

Since the end of 2022, I have been using `GitHub` with `RStudio` and `Quarto` to learn, produce, and share code. Occasionally, I use `Matlab` and `Python` too.

I am experienced in teaching statistics, research methods, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience; and my immediate goal is to become a permanent (tenure-track) `lecturer in psychology`. Psychology and science fascinate me a great deal and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science and contribute to open science.

## Fields of Research

- Human flourishing
- Diversity in religious groups
- Contemplative neuroscience
- Cognitive psychology: memory suppression
