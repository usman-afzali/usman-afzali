# Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a postdoctoral research fellow and PI of [`A national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing`](https://usman-afzali.github.io/muslim-flourishing-nz/), based at University of Canterbury in New Zealand.

Since the end of 2022, I have been using `GitHub` with `RStudio` and `Quarto` to learn, produce, and share code. Occasionally, I use `Matlab` and `Python` too.

Psychology fascinates me a great deal and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science and contribute to open science.

I am experienced in teaching statistics and research methods and my immediate goal is to become a permanent (tenure-track) `lecturer in psychology`.
